# pdfs
My first  website .
I made this small website using Python Django framework . 
For this you need to have some knowledge on Python and its modules Django and MySQL.
I used MySQL database to retrieve user information,to save user information and to save user activity .
You also need MySQL workbench to work with the database tables .
The main objective of this website is to provide the documents,pdfs,etc. to the students .
The documents,pdfs are first uploaded to google drive and than that document link is uploaded to this website .
And also students can also upload the files but that file has to be approved by the faculty(which is done in the website only).
The files which are uploaded by the students are avilable in the website to other students only after apporval.
To access this files or documents the user must have an account.
So that students can easily access that documents anywhere and anytime .
Currently the website is under development.
